After further study and [experimentation](/zsh/args-in-variable/), I've made some changes to the first version of my [bindlist](/zsh/bindlist/) function.



## `bindlist` v0.2

{% gist b04a27d05710d857cbefb5801997915a %}

Called without options, the output looks like this:

<figure style="width: 600px" class="align-center">
  <a href="/assets/ss/bindlist.jpg" title="screenshot - output of function: bindlist" alt="screenshot - output of function: bindlist">
  <img src="/assets/ss/bindlist.jpg" alt="screenshot -  output of function: bindlist"></a>

</figure>


## Change notes

*Refactored for my educational purposes. No changes to function behavior.*

Patterns are now assembled in an array instead of a string:

```zsh
patterns=(
  "\^\[\["      # match "^[["
  "\^\[O[A-H]"  # match "^[OA"..."^[OH"
  "^\"\\\M"     # match "\M-^@"-"\M-^?"
  "\"-\"~\""    # match " "-"~"
  )
```

Previously, patterns were concatenated, in a function, like this:

```zsh
for item in ${*}
do
  _e_patterns=${_e_patterns}$(printf ' -e '\''%s'\' ${item})
done
```

Now patterns are concatenated like this, without calling a separate function:

```zsh
for pat in $patterns
do
  estring=$estring" -e '"$pat"'"
done
```

This method was used to execute a command with the concatenated patterns:

```zsh
_cmd=$(printf 'grep -v%s\n' "${_e_patterns}")
_list=$(bindkey | eval "$(printf '%s' ${_cmd})")
```

Which has been simplified to this:

```zsh
cmd="grep -v $estring"
_list=$(bindkey | eval $cmd)
```
