Zsh on macOS has a tremendous amount of [useful keyboard shortcuts](/macos/zsh-keys/) enabled by default. It's a long list, which I wanted to display in the shell in a more compact, readable format than `bindkey` provides.


```zsh
bindkey # list all keybindings
```

**Remove special keys from the list**

The special keys (up, home, end, etc), which I don't want to list, are defined with certain character sequences. I'll use `grep -v` to remove lines that match the sequences I want to exclude.

The first sequence to remove—which, I'll admit, I don't even really understand—, is `^[[`:

```zsh
bindkey | grep -v '\^\[\['
```

That removes six bindings I don't even understand.

Other special key sequences I want to remove are `"^[[OA"`, `"^[[OB"`, etc, which can be matched with the regex pattern `\^\[O[A-H]"`, which I add to the first pattern:

```zsh
bindkey | grep -v - e '\^\[\[' -e '\^\[O[A-H]"'
```

The `-e` flag of `grep` is used to specify multiple patterns.
{: .notice}


That gets the list down to the bindings I want to include.

**Formatting**

To make it more readable, I want to remove the quotes around the key definitions. The first quote is removed with `sed 's/^"//g'` and the second with `sed 's/" / /g'`.

```zsh
bindkey | grep -v -e '\^\[\[' -e '\^\[O[A-H]"' \
| sed -e 's/^"//g' -e 's/" / /g'
```

The `-e` flag can also be used with `sed` to specify multiple patterns.
{: .notice}


Add one more subsitution, `-e 's/\^\[/⌥/g'`, to replace the meta key (`^[`) with the option symbol (`⌥`):

```zsh
bindkey | grep -v -e '\^\[\[' -e '\^\[O[A-H]"' \
| sed -e 's/^"//g' -e 's/" / /g' -e 's/\^\[/⌥/g'
```

Quoted, printed into columns, and aliased, is this syntax nightmare:

```zsh
alias binds='IFS=$'\''\n'\''; print -c $(bindkey | grep -v -e '\''\^\[\['\'' -e '\''\^\[O[A-H]"'\'' -e '\''^"\\M'\'' -e '\''"-"~"'\'' | sed -e '\''s/^"//g'\'' -e '\''s/" / /g'\'' -e '\''s/\^\[/⌥/g'\'' -e '\''s/\^\?/DEL/g'\''); unset IFS'
```

## Display in columns

The `print` command, with the `-c` flag, can ouput the result in columns that fit the terminal. But I need to change the `IFS` characters so it doesn't split spaces into a newlines:

```zsh
IFS=$'\n'
print -c -- $(bindkey | grep -v -e '\^\[\[' -e '\^\[O[A-H]"' | sed -e 's/^"//g' -e 's/" / /g' -e 's/\^\[/⌥/g')
unset IFS
```

`IFS` returns to its default value when it's `unset` in zsh.
{: .notice}

## Make an alias

I wouldn't have any idea how to quote the above multiline command, but zsh does.

After running the above command, press the up arrow to place it on the command line again, then press <kbd>opt</kbd><kbd>'</kbd> (apostrophe) to quote it. Then, without pressing enter yet, navigate to the beginning of the line ( <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>a</kbd>) and insert `alias bind=` in front. It will end up looking like this:

```zsh
alias binds='IFS=$'\''\n'\''
print -c -- $(bindkey | grep -v -e '\''\^\[\['\'' -e '\''\^\[O[A-H]"'\'' | sed -e '\''s/^"//g'\'' -e '\''s/" / /g'\'' -e '\''s/\^\[/⌥/g'\'')
unset IFS'
```

Then press return to define the alias, which looks like this in use on my machine:

<figure style="width: 600px" class="align-center">
  <a href="/assets/ss/binds.jpg" title="screenshot - output of alias: binds" alt="screenshot - output of alias: binds">
  <img src="/assets/ss/binds.jpg" alt="screenshot -  output of alias: binds"></a>
  <figcaption>screenshot -  output of alias: binds</figcaption>
</figure>

I'll assume you know how to save an alias to a config file or can find the answer yourself.
