Knowing how to use the ubiquitous shell pager “less” is an essential command line skill.

This page is intended as both an introduction to `less` and a quick reference for the “intermediate” commands and options I end up forgetting and relearning about once a year.
{: .notice }

Written in the mid-1980s and still maintained today by the same author, `less` has been ported to numerous operating systems and is the default pager on most Unix-like platforms.

Most shell users are likely to encounter `less` while viewing manual pages with the `man` command.

</figure>

Because it doesn't need to load the entire file before starting, `less` is also particularly well suited for examining large text files.

## Basic Usage

These are *some* of the basic `less` commands and options, not a complete list.

### Options

{% capture about-options %}
Most of the option flags that can applied from the command line can also toggled on and off while `less` is running by pressing “–” (hyphen) followed by the appropriate letter.

For example, to toggle line wrapping while `less` is running, press <kbd>–</kbd> then <kbd>S</kbd>.

## Other features

The basic commands above barely scratch the surface. If you use `less` regularly, you'll probably want to explore some of these features as well.

### `$LESS` - defaults

Store preferred options in the variable `LESS`. For example, to have `less` have start with the `-e` (exit at end of file), `-X` (no init, i.e. don't redraw screen), and `-F` (quit if file fits in one screen) options, add this to your shell configuration:

```zsh
export LESS='-eFX'
```

Options specified in the command line override those stored in the `LESS` variable.

To reset an option set in the `LESS` variable to the default, call `less` with the option specified with `-+`:

```zsh
less -+XF   # set -X and -F options to default
```

### Working with files

These are the basic commands for working with multiple files in `less`:

| **Files**                                                                   |
| <kbd>:</kbd><kbd>e</kbd> *file*  | examine (load) *file*                    |
| <kbd>:</kbd><kbd>n</kbd>         | next file                                |
| <kbd>:</kbd><kbd>p</kbd>         | previous file                            |
| <kbd>s</kbd> *file*              | save piped content as *file*             |
| <kbd>v</kbd>                     | edit current file with `$VISUAL` or `$EDITOR` |

There are many additional features for working for multiple files. See the manual page for more information.


### Shell commands

| <kbd>!</kbd> *shell-command*     | run shell command                        |
| <kbd>\|</kbd> *mark-letter* *shell-command* | pipe input to shell command   |


{% capture about-pipe %}
The `|` command pipes input from `less` into a shell command. For example, to save an entire man page to a text file (piping it through `col -b` to remove terminal formatting):

Press <kbd>g</kbd> to jump to the beginning and <kbd>|</kbd> to start the pipe command. Enter `$` (end of document) as the mark. Then enter `col -b > filepath` as the shell command.

{% endcapture %}<div class="notice--primary">{{ about-pipe | markdownify }}</div>
