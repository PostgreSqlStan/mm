TLDR: &nbsp; `man col | col -b`

Use `col -b` to remove text formatting (backspaces) from any shell output.

---

Formatted (bold, colorized, etc) text in a terminal relies on backspace hacks, which looks like this when piped into a text editor:

![](/assets/ss/man2txt.jpg)

Use the `-b` (backspace) flag with the `col` command to remove the backspaces used to format text:

```zsh
man col | col -b
```
