In the spirit of learning in public, I've created [pgtab](https://github.com/PostgreSqlStan/pgtab), a simple PostgreSQL database for JSON [Tabular Data Packages](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/).

It doesn't do much, but contains examples of importing, parsing, and building JSON objects, a few procedures and functions, and at least one table trigger that's probably a [terrible idea](https://github.com/PostgreSqlStan/pgtab/issues/2).

There's also a [psql UI hack](https://github.com/PostgreSqlStan/pgtab/blob/main/sql/03_go.sql), made up of schemas, views, and procedures that can be used to navigate and edit individual records. It might be of some interest to weirdos like me who try to do everything in psql.

[Feedback](https://github.com/PostgreSqlStan/pgtab/discussions/new/choose) is welcome, especially if you want to tell me what I've done wrong.
