At the end of a [previous post](/zsh/binds/) about zsh key bindings, I was left with this syntax monstrosity:

```zsh
alias binds='IFS=$'\''\n'\''
print -c -- $(bindkey | grep -v -e '\''\^\[\['\'' -e '\''\^\[O[A-H]"'\'' | sed -e '\''s/^"//g'\'' -e '\''s/" / /g'\'' -e '\''s/\^\[/‚å•/g'\'')
unset IFS'
```

It hurts to look at, which inspired me to write a much longer function that accomplishes the same, plus some additional options.

The help option explains what it does:

```
% bindlist -h
Usage:
  bindlist              list bindings
  bindlist -h|--help    print this message
Options:
  -a --all              include all bindings
  -l --list             single column output
  -r --raw              bindkey format
```
<br>
Called without options, the output looks like this:

<figure style="width: 600px" class="align-center">
  <a href="/assets/ss/bindlist.jpg" title="screenshot - output of function: bindlist" alt="screenshot - output of function: bindlist">
  <img src="/assets/ss/bindlist.jpg" alt="screenshot -  output of function: bindlist"></a>
  <figcaption>screenshot -  output of function: bindlist</figcaption>
</figure>

There are probably better methods for everything this function does. I'm just amazed I got it to work at all. I learned a few things along the way.

I still haven't figured how to enable the `_gnu_generic` completions *and* suppress file completions. I figured out how to do one or the other, but not both, so settled on `buildlist` being able to autocomplete its options. It also (harmlessly) lists completions for files, despite not excepting any arguments, which I hope to fix some day.
