Overall, I’m impressed.

Before today I had no experience with ruby. A few hours later, using only the web interface, I have a decent looking, functional blog using [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.

That’s the good news.

OTOH, using Jekyll for non-blog content is, so far, an entirely different matter. [Jekyll Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), which looks like the best approach for my needs, is not as simple or intuitive as just adding a file to the correct folder. My progress has been slow. 

The example entries in the `_posts` folder included in the theme [starter repo](https://github.com/mmistakes/mm-github-pages-starter/generate) were extremely useful. 

Some example pages and categories would probably help a lot.
