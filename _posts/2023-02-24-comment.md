One of my favorite PostgreSQL features is the ability to attach a comment to an object.

```sql
COMMENT ON object_type object_name IS 'text'
```

For example, create a schema and add a comment to it:

```sql
create schema comment_demo;
comment on schema comment_demo is 'comments demo';
```

Append `+` to the psql meta-command to list schemas (`\dn`) to show comments:

```
stan=> \dn+ comment_demo
                  List of schemas
   Name       │ Owner │ Access privileges │  Description
──────────────┼───────┼───────────────────┼───────────────
 comment_demo │ stan  │                   │ comments demo
```

Set a comment to NULL to remove it:

```sql
comment on schema comment_demo is NULL;
```

Unless you have superuser privileges, you can't add a comment to an object you don't own:

```
stan=> comment on schema public is 'not owned by me';
ERROR:  must be owner of schema public
```

A comment can be attached to a wide variety of objects:

```
stan=> \h comment
Command:     COMMENT
Description: define or change the comment of an object
