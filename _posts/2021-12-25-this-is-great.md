I must say, I'm very impressed by the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme! The excellent [docs](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) are making it easy to learn how to configure and customize.

This is all coming together quicker and easier than I imagined. I've done everything purely with the web interface so far. I'll integrate my local tools soon, but they're not even necessary.

I really love all the different options for notice formatting.

**Success Notice:** These notice boxes are very useful.
