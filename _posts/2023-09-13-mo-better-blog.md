excerpt: "I now realize writing for myself is the best way for me to share more with others, and that’s what I intend to do. Typos be damned."

I was recently inspired by this exchange between [Claire Giordano](https://hachyderm.io/@clairegiordano) and [Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw) in a episode of [Path To Citus Con Podcast](https://share.transistor.fm/s/f6209619):

>Claire: So if we wanna dive into today's topic, I guess I'll just start with a super open-ended question. Like what do you both see as the benefits of working in public? Start with the positives.
>
>Simon: So the thing for me is that the work that I do, I never want to have to solve the same problem twice, ever.

My motivation for sharing this collection of command line notes is somewhat different. More than anything, I write to learn. Nothing clarifies my understanding of a topic better than trying to explain it in concise, coherent sentences.

But I've been too focused on making my sentences understandable for *others*—an elusive goal—and it's been slowing me down.

Thanks to Simon, I now realize writing for myself is also the best way for me to share more with others, and that's what I intend to do. Typos be damned. Hopefully, with regular practice, I might even get better at it.
