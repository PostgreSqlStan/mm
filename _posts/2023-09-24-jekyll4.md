After a long session getting [Ruby 3.2.2 to compile on macOS Ventura](/macos/build-ruby/), I had a longer, less patient session getting the jekyll 4.3.2 gem to work with this site. Eventually, with help from notes by a Windows user in China dealing with a similar issue, I managed to get things sorted.

Most of the issues I ran into were probably related to my lack of understanding of `gem` and `bundle` commands, which I still don't really understand and won't get into here.

The one interesting problem (and solution) was related to an invalid certificate error for a github.com IP which was definitely valid. I really didn't want to mess with the OS to solve this and was delighted to somehow stumble upon this easy [workaround](https://github.com/mzlogin/mzlogin.github.io/wiki/Problems-and-solutions-when-run-Jekyll-on-Windows):

**Problem**

```
SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B: certificate verify failed
```

**Solution**

1. Download [https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem](https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem)
2. Add a environment variable `SSL_CERT_FILE` set to `/path/to/cacert.pem`

---

In my case, I saved the `cacert.pem` file in a `.bundle` directory in this site, which is not tracked by git, then added this line to a function that launches jekyll for the site:

```zsh
export SSL_CERT_FILE=~/repos/postgresqlstan.github.io/.bundle/cacert.pem
```

:heavy_check_mark: It worked. We all deserve a nap now.
