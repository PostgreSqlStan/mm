I created this website to share knowledge and thoughts about CLI software used for data wrangling and web publishing. 

Topics include PostgreSQL, git, Jekyll, Python, shell commands and scripting, as well as directions for compiling and installing open source software on macOS without relying on package managers.

I would be delighted if anyone else finds this information useful. Please, contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PostgreSQLStan) if you have any questions or comments.

{% capture notice-2 %}
This site is built with [Git Pages](https://pages.github.com), which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate web content from a [public repository](https://github.com/PostgreSqlStan/postgresqlstan.github.io). The appearance is managed by the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.
