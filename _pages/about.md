title: "About this Site"

I created this site to share knowledge, tips, links and thoughts about command line software I use for web publishing, data wrangling, and other related tasks.

[Topics](/tags/) include git, Jekyll, PostgreSQL, Python, shell commands and scripting, and directions for installing some of the open source software I use on macOS.

Hopefully, others find some of this information useful. *If not, at least I'll be able to find to my notes the next time I need to repeat a task documented here.* üòÅ

Please, contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PostgreSQLStan) if you have any questions or comments.

{% capture notice-2 %}
This site is built with [Git Pages](https://pages.github.com), which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate web content from a [public repository](https://github.com/PostgreSqlStan/postgresqlstan.github.io). The appearance is managed by the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.
