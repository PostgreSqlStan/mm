After using PostgreSQL on macOS for data wrangling on macOS for around twenty years and have finally decided to keep my notes in a public repository.

This site uses the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) Jekyll theme and is hosted by [Github pages](https://pages.github.com).

Comments are welcome. Contact me via Twitter.
