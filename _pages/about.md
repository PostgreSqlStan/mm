I created this site to share knowledge, tips, links and thoughts about command line software I use for web publishing, data wrangling, and other related tasks.

Hopefully, others find some of this information useful. *If not, at least I'll be able to find to my notes the next time I need to repeat a task documented here.* üòÅ

This site is built with [Git Pages](https://pages.github.com), which uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to generate web content from a [public repository](https://github.com/PostgreSqlStan/postgresqlstan.github.io). The appearance is managed by the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.
